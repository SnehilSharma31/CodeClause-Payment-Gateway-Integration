# Payment Gateway Integration

## Deployed Website Link -> https://snehilsharma31.github.io/Payment-Gateway-Integration/

◉ This Repo showcases my project, that I've created for my Internship task at CodeClause.

◉ This is a simple website that integrates a payment gateway to facilitate online donations. The website features a homepage with a donate button, which, upon clicking, directs the user to a payment page. On the payment page, users can select the donation amount and choose their preferred payment method, such as credit card, UPI, PayPal, and more.

◉ Once the payment is successfully processed, an invoice is generated, and an email is sent to the user confirming the payment received. The invoice will include the details of the donation, including the amount contributed.

◉ To facilitate payment gateway integration, temporary accounts with RazorPay is created. These accounts allow for testing and demonstration purposes without incurring actual financial transactions.
